There exist several manuals on how to install Linpus from a recovery DVD.

Basically you just boot the recovery DVD on some PC, select "*create rescue usb key*" and insert a 2 GiB (or more)
usb key.

:warning: 1 GiB won't work - the recovery image is slightly larger :warning:

After the recovery stick has been created, you can plug it into the AAO and start the recovery process. This wipes
the complete harddisk so make sure you have a backup of your important data.
