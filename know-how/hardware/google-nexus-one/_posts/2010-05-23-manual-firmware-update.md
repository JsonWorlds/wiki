To manually update the firmware, put the new firmware named as `update.zip` onto the root directory of the microSD card.
Then do this: (found at [androidspin.com](http://forum.androidspin.com/showthread.php?t=2631))

  - power off the phone
  - hold down the trackball and press the Power button.
  - you'll get a white screen with three Android robots on skateboards â†’ select *Bootloader*
  - now select *Recovery*
  - the phone will reboot showing a robot and a warning sign
  - now press Power and Volume up together (if it doesn't work the first time, try again)
  - now choose *Apply sdcard:update.zip* (use trackball!)
  - wait for it to finish
  - choose *Reboot now*
