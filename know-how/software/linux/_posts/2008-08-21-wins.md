To enable lookup of WINS-names in Ubuntu, edit the file ˋ/etc/nsswitch.confˋ and find the line:

    hosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4

Append ˋwinsˋ to the end of the line so that it looks like this:

    hosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4 wins

From now on you can also use NetBIOS names to address PCs in your LAN.
