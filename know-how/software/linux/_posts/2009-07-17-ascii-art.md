To create ASCII art or just some colorful things with lots of ANSI color codes, there's the package
[aewan](apt://aewan) - [Ascii-art Editor Without A Name](http://aewan.sf.net/).

aewan itself saves the files in an own format. But there's the tool `aecat` which lets you cat those files - and thus
you can also write the output into another file to get a normal file with ANSI codes which can be shown using the
normal `cat`.
